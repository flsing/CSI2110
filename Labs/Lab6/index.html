<h1>Lab 6</h1>
<hr>
<h2>AVL and BST Height Comparison</h2>
<p>
Study the AVL tree implementation of Goodrich et al. The approach
consists of an AVL tree implementation <tt>AVLTree.java</tt> extending
the binary search tree implementation <tt>BinarySearchTree.java</tt>
which is implemented with a linked list
<tt>LinkedBinaryTree.java</tt>. We have seen the linked binary tree
implementation before -- see Lab 5. These classes are all
part of the net.datastructures package which is contained (as far as
required) in the zip archive for this lab.
</p>

<p>
Study the code in the skeleton <tt>Verify.java</tt>. You have to
implement the two missing methods such that <tt>Verify</tt>
prints statistics about the heights of regular Binary Search Trees and
AVL trees. 
</p>

<p>
The method <tt>void randomTrees( int _noNodes, int _nTrees )</tt>
creates <tt>_nTrees</tt> trees with <tt>_noNodes</tt> at random. It
inserts random integer keys in a BST and AVL tree. The class Verify is
employed to keep track of the height of each tree and records the
minimum, maximum and average height for the AVL and BST trees.
</p>
 
<p>
The method <tt><T> int height( BinaryTree<T> bTree )</tt> calculates
the height of any binary tree. 
</p>


<p> 
The program output should look as follows:
