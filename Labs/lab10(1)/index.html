<h1>Lab 10</h1>
</p>

<h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm </h2>
<p>
Download the archive <tt>Lab10.zip</tt> and extract the
<tt>WeightGraph</tt> application. The application is similar to
<tt>SimpleGraph</tt> except that it expects to read an edge-list from
a file where the edges are weighted. The archive contains the
airports' example from the textbook in the file
<tt>airports.txt</tt>. The Graph is again stored as
<tt>AdjacencyListGraph</tt> and the application simple prints all the
vertices followed by all the edges for verification.
</p>

<h2>Study the Goodrich et al. Implementation</h2>
<p>
Study the <tt>Dijkstra</tt> implementation by Goodrich et al. The
implementation follows closely our discussion in class. Notice that
the algorithm assumes that the edges of the graph have been decorated
with a key <tt>WEIGHT</tt>. Before constructing Dijkstra, you will
need to make sure that the edges in your graph have been
decorated. Note that the class <tt>Edge</tt> implements
<tt>DecorablePosition</tt> which enables you to store a (Key,Value)
pairs with an edge. You will need to add a line of code to <tt>void
WeightGraph.read()</tt> to appropriately decorate the edge.
</p>


<h2>Find the Shortest Path</h2>
<p>
The program <tt>WeightGraph</tt> has a routine <tt> void
printAllShortestDistances( String vert )</tt> which currently does
nothing. Please implement this routine by constructing a
<tt>Dijkstra</tt> object and calling the <tt>execute</tt> method on
it. After execution, the routine should print the distance between the
source vertex and all other vertices with a name longer than 2
letters. In this way, you may define intermediate vertices for the
graph but they will not be printed.
</p>


<h2>Road Map Graph</h2>
<p>
The image belows shows a simplified road map of eastern
Ontario. Define a suitable graph for the roadmap (or part of it) which
will allow you to find the shortest from all the named cities or
towns. Notice that you need additionally vertices in-between the
towns. If you use names with no more than two letters, they will not
interfere with printing. Create a new textfile and find all shortest
path from Ottawa with the application.
