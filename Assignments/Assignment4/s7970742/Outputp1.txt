** MyGraphTest1: testing class MyGraph only.
** VertexNames={zero,one,two,three} for Vertices {0,1,2,3}
** EdgeSet={ {0,1},{0,2}, {0,3}, {2,3}, {1,3} } with weights 1,2,3,4,5

Now testing each method:

Testing Constructor...
Completed Constructor.

numVertices()=4
numEdges()=5
vertices() and show indices:
edges() and show weights:


Testing getEdge(v,w) for each pair of vertices (v,w) and showing distances:

Testing: endVertices, opposite

**End Test !!!
